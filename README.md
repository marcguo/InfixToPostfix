# InfixToPostfix

Some systems work more efficiently using Reverse Polish Notation (Postfix Notation) with expressions, and for this reason, they are designed to use RPN. However, it might be difficult at times for a user to understand an expression's meaning. This utility was made to evaluate simple logic and math expressions.

Next steps:
1. Integrate this utility as an API.
2. Make a website that allows everyone to use this Postfix (RPN) to Infix utility.
